## 📚 What is Semantic Chunking?

### Core Concept
Semantic chunking uses pre-trained transformer-based embedding models to understand the **meaning** of text rather than just splitting based on character count or structural boundaries.

### How Embedding Models Work
1. **Neural Networks**: Transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa, etc.) trained on massive text corpora
2. **Vector Representation**: Convert text into high-dimensional numerical vectors (embeddings)
3. **Semantic Similarity**: Similar meanings produce similar vectors, enabling mathematical comparison
4. **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the angle between vectors (0=unrelated, 1=identical meaning)

### The Semantic Chunking Process
```
Input Text → Sentence Splitting → Embedding Generation → Similarity Calculation → Semantic Grouping → Final Chunks
```

1. **Sentence Segmentation**: Split text into individual sentences using regex patterns
2. **Embedding Generation**: Convert each sentence to a vector using SentenceTransformer
3. **Similarity Matrix**: Calculate cosine similarity between all sentence pairs (sklearn)
4. **Semantic Grouping**: Group sentences with similarity above threshold
5. **Size Management**: Respect chunk size constraints while preserving semantic coherence

## 🧠 SentenceTransformer Models Explained

### What is SentenceTransformer?
SentenceTransformer is a Python framework that provides easy access to pre-trained transformer models specifically optimized for generating sentence-level embeddings.

### Model Categories

#### Lightweight Models (384 dimensions)
- **all-MiniLM-L6-v2**: 22M parameters, fastest, good balance
- **all-MiniLM-L12-v2**: 33M parameters, better quality than L6

#### High-Quality Models (768 dimensions)  
- **all-mpnet-base-v2**: 109M parameters, excellent general-purpose
- **paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2**: 109M parameters, specialized for paraphrase detection

#### Multilingual Models
- **paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2**: 384-dim, supports 50+ languages
- **paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2**: 768-dim, high-quality multilingual

#### Specialized Models
- **msmarco-distilbert-base-v4**: Optimized for search and retrieval tasks
- **multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1**: Specialized for question-answering

### Model Selection Criteria

| Requirement | Recommended Model | Reason |
|-------------|------------------|---------|
| Speed Priority | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | Fastest inference, good quality |
| Quality Priority | `all-mpnet-base-v2` | Highest quality for English |
| Multilingual | `paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2` | 50+ languages, balanced |
| RAG/Search | `msmarco-distilbert-base-v4` | Optimized for retrieval |
| Q&A Systems | `multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1` | Specialized for questions |

## 🔧 Enhanced Implementation Details

### Sklearn Integration
```python
# Old: Custom cosine similarity
similarity = self._cosine_similarity(embeddings[i], embeddings[j])

# New: Sklearn vectorized computation
similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(embeddings)
similarity = similarity_matrix[i, j]
```

**Benefits:**
- **Performance**: Vectorized operations are much faster
- **Reliability**: Well-tested, optimized implementation
- **Memory Efficiency**: Better handling of large embedding matrices

### Enhanced Sentence Splitting
```python
# Improved regex pattern
self.sentence_pattern = re.compile(r'(?<=[.!?])\s+(?=[A-Z])')
```

**Improvements:**
- Looks for capital letter after sentence ending
- Avoids splitting on abbreviations like "Dr. Smith"
- Avoids splitting on decimals like "3.14"

### Model Loading with Progress
```python
@property
def model(self) -> SentenceTransformer:
    if self._model is None:
        print(f"Loading SentenceTransformer model: {self.model_name}")
        self._model = SentenceTransformer(self.model_name)
        print(f"Model loaded. Embedding dimension: {self._model.get_sentence_embedding_dimension()}")
    return self._model
```

**Benefits:**
- User feedback during model loading
- Dimension information for debugging
- Lazy loading for efficiency

## 📊 Performance Characteristics

### Speed Comparison
| Model | Dimensions | Parameters | Relative Speed | Use Case |
|-------|------------|------------|----------------|----------|
| all-MiniLM-L6-v2 | 384 | 22M | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Production speed |
| all-MiniLM-L12-v2 | 384 | 33M | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Balanced |
| all-mpnet-base-v2 | 768 | 109M | ⭐⭐⭐ | Quality focus |
| multilingual-mpnet | 768 | 278M | ⭐⭐ | Multilingual quality |

### Quality vs Speed Trade-offs
- **Higher dimensions** = Better semantic understanding, slower processing
- **More parameters** = Better model capacity, larger memory usage
- **Specialized models** = Better for specific tasks, may be slower for general use

## 🛠️ Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from src.chunkers.semantic import SemanticChunker

# Create chunker with default lightweight model
chunker = SemanticChunker()

# Get model information
info = chunker.get_model_info()
print(f"Model: {info['model_name']}, Dimensions: {info['embedding_dimension']}")

# Chunk document
chunks = chunker.chunk(document)
```

### Advanced Configuration
```python
# High-quality semantic chunking
chunker = SemanticChunker(
    model_name="all-mpnet-base-v2",
    similarity_threshold=0.8,  # Stricter grouping
    chunk_size=1200,
    min_sentences_per_chunk=3
)

# Get model recommendations
models = SemanticChunker.get_recommended_models()
print(models['high_quality'])
```

```python
# Multilingual semantic chunking
chunker = SemanticChunker(
    model_name="paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2",
    similarity_threshold=0.7,  # Lower threshold for cross-language similarity
